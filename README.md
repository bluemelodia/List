## Known Issues

- updateOn: "submit" does not work consistently with all input forms. dateAndTimeValidator runs in-between submits (ex. user updates the Add Meeting datepicker field, and the error will update in real time, instead of on the next submit).

## TODO

- Ensure that all fields are propagating edits correctly (birthdays/settings).
- Test in all browsers.
- UI Incorrectly hides all meetings and recurrence is not correctly populated.
- Port app to server-side, and make sure that cron jobs are schedule for multiple users.
