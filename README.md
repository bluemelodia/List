## TODO

- User logins and session. Modify logic so that users only see their own account information.
- Daily jobs scanning for upcoming birthdays and events.
- Allow users to add one-time events (ex. dentist's appointments, social outings)
- Allow users to add recurring events
- Allow users to add reminders (ex. payment reminders)
- Show users a calendar of upcoming events.

- Make the app more responsive, adding animations.
- Make edit/delete buttons less obvious, ie. interact with the cell first to show these options.

- Show a list of upcoming events on the home page (four widgets, so four sections).
