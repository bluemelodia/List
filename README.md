## TODO

- User logins and session. Modify logic so that users only see their own account information.
- Daily jobs scanning for upcoming birthdays and events.
- Allow users to add reminders (ex. payment reminders)
- Let users budget gifts for friends/family and keep track of their addresses. Let users enter a budget/email/address for each recipient (for sending gifts) - the gifts page will sync this same thing and also get gift history.
- Show users a calendar of upcoming events.
- Text users the meeting reminder.
- Make birthday cells shorter so that users can see more in one row.

- Make the app more responsive, adding animations.
- Allow users to edit/delete more easily (ex. on click).
- Make edit/delete buttons less obvious, ie. interact with the cell first to show these options.

- Show a list of upcoming events on the home page (four widgets, so four sections).
- Add accessibility, don't have two modals open at the same time.
- Add ESLinting
